# Project_Skills

Organised markdown document model created to make project information easy to complete and maintain.

- For those who wants find a dataset to build a project: [Open datasets](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/)

## TODO -> project's name

### Background

- Problem Statement / Problem Overview
- Current state vs desired future state

### Project Purpose and Objectives

-> Define what the project aims to achieve by listing SMART Objectives

- S: (Specific)
  - Who – Consider who needs to be involved to achieve the goal (this is especially important when you’re working on a group project).
  - What – Think about exactly what you are trying to accomplish and don’t be afraid to get very detailed.
  - When – You’ll get more specific about this question under the “timebound” section of defining SMART goals, but you      should at least set a time frame.
  - Where – This question may not always apply, especially if you’re setting personal goals, but if there’s a location or relevant event, identify it here.
  - Which – Determine any related obstacles or requirements. This question can be beneficial in deciding if your goal is realistic. For example, if the goal is to open a baking business, but you’ve never baked anything before, that might be an issue. As a result, you may refine the specifics of the goal to be “Learn how to bake in order to open a baking business."
  - Why – What is the reason for the goal? When it comes to using this method for employees, the answer will likely be along the lines of company advancement or career development.

- M: (Measurable)
  - If it’s a project that’s going to take a few months to complete, then set some milestones by considering specific tasks to accomplish.

- A: (Archievable)
  - This focuses on how important a goal is to you and what you can do to make it attainable and may require developing new skills and changing attitudes. Think about how to accomplish the goal and if you have the tools/skills needed. If you don’t currently possess those tools/skills, consider what it would take to attain them.

- R: (Relevant)
  - Relevance refers focusing on something that makes sense with the broader business goals.

- T: (Time-Bound)
  - Ask specific questions about the goal deadline and what can be accomplished within that time period. If the goal will take three months to complete, it’s useful to define what should be achieved half-way through the process. Providing time constraints also creates a sense of urgency.

### Project Scope

-> Define the project boundaries.

**Feature list (Brainstorm):**

- TODO

-> Decide what is included (major deliverables) and what is excluded (MoSCoW model):

- ***Must have and why:***
  - test test
- ***Should have and why:***
  - TODO
- ***Could have and why:***
  - TODO
- ***Won't have and why:***
  - TODO

**Reflection:**

- Are there too many high-effort “Must Haves”?
- Are there too many high-effort “Must Haves”?

**Final Scope Sumary:**

- Final In Scope (Launch Version) -> TODO
- Explicitly Out of Scope -> TODO

**Team Reflection:**

- What feature caused the most disagreement?
- What trade-off did your team struggle with most?
- What is the biggest risk in your prioritisation?

### Key Deliverables

-> TODO List major outputs the project will produce, example:

- What do you intend to show at the Project Showcase?
- What will your project deliver?

### Risk and Constraint

-> TODO: Identify any threats at the outset that could impact delivery of the project and any limitations that may affect the quality of the output.

### Summary Milestones Scheduled

-> Provide major milestone dates (No detailed task breakdown needed - just high level details)

### Project Team, Roles and resposability

  **Group Roles:**

    - TODO

- Member 1 : responsability

  --------------------------(signature)

- Member 2 : resposability

  --------------------------(signature)

- Member 3 : responsability

  --------------------------(signature)

- Member 4 : responsability

  --------------------------(signature)
